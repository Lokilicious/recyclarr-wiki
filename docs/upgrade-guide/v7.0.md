## Breaking Changes

Features have been removed *or* behavior changed. Most of the items here would have been deprecated
in the past. Deprecations are always mentioned in release notes for minor version bumps.

### Path Change on MacOS {#osx-path-change}

:::caution

If you are not running Recyclarr on MacOS, **no action is needed!**

:::

The [app data directory](../file-structure.md#appdata-directory) path has changed for only the MacOS
platform. This is due to a [breaking change][net8] introduced in .NET 8.

In Recyclarr v6 and earlier, the path to the app data directory is:

```sh
~/.config/recyclarr
```

Starting in v7, the new path is located at:

```sh
~/Library/Application Support/recyclarr
```

There is a required [migration step][mig] that will inform you if the data directory should be
moved. Use the [`recyclarr migrate`][cmd] command to have Recyclarr attempt to move the directory
for you.
