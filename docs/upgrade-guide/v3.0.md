## Breaking Changes

This version removes a few deprecated features. If you still use any of these features, action is
required to avoid errors next time you run Recyclarr.

### Removed Names Support for Custom Formats

Previously, you were allowed to specify names (instead of Trash IDs) in the `custom_formats` list:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - names:
      - 1080p
```

The `names` array has been removed and is no longer supported. Migrate your CFs (manually) to the
`trash_ids` list:

```yml
custom_formats:
  - trash_ids:
      - 820b09bb9acbfde9c35c71e0e565dad8 # 1080p
```

This migration is a manual process. You will need to use the output of the `--list-custom-formats`
CLI option and manually copy & paste the CFs you want.

### No Longer Load `recyclarr.yml` Sitting Next to Executable

The `recyclarr.yml` configuration file is no longer loaded if it's sitting next to where the
Recyclarr executable lives on the filesystem. From now on, the only valid (default) location for
this file is at the root of your [Application Data Directory][appdata].

[appdata]: ../file-structure.md#appdata-directory

### Git Required On Host Systems

If you're using the [Manual Installation](/installation/manual-install.md) method, you must now
install Git on your system in order to run Recyclarr. Prior to v3.0.0, Recyclarr had an
implementation of Git bundled inside it, so it would work even if you didn't have Git installed.
However, this implementation caused multiple issues, including a continuously-growing Repo
directory.

Due to the limitations of that implementation, Recyclarr now runs git commands on your shell, and
thus requires the git executable to be installed and on your `PATH` (or you can specify a path to it
via your [settings](/reference/settings-reference.md#repo-settings)).

## Deprecations

The features below are *deprecated*. This means they are now marked for removal in a future release,
but for now are still supported. You may see warnings in your console output & logs informing you of
these deprecated features if you are using them.

### Instances Must Now Be Named

Prior to this release, your list of instances used *array-style* syntax, which look like this:

```yml
radarr:
  - base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc
  - base_url: http://localhost:7879
    api_key: 789def
```

This style is deprecated. Going forward, all instances must use *mapping-style* syntax instead.
Convert the above to something like this:

```yml
radarr:
  instance1:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc
  instance2:
    base_url: http://localhost:7879
    api_key: 789def
```

Where `instance1` and `instance2` can be any names you want as long as they are valid YAML. These
names are useful for several reasons, such as:

- They allow easier identification in logs, cache, and other places.
- May be used in the future on the CLI for selective updates.
