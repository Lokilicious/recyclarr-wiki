## Breaking Changes

Features have been removed *or* behavior changed. Most of the items here would have been deprecated
in the past. Deprecations are always mentioned in release notes for minor version bumps.

### Instances Must Now Be Named

This was deprecated starting in v3.0. With this major release, array-style syntax support is now
completely removed. Prior to the v3.0 release, your list of instances used *array-style* syntax,
which look like this:

```yml
radarr:
  - base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc
  - base_url: http://localhost:7879
    api_key: 789def
```

Going forward, all instances must use *mapping-style* syntax instead. Convert the above to something
like this:

```yml
radarr:
  instance1:
    base_url: http://localhost:7878
    api_key: 123abc
  instance2:
    base_url: http://localhost:7879
    api_key: 789def
```

Where `instance1` and `instance2` can be any names you want as long as they are valid YAML. These
names are useful for several reasons, such as:

- They allow easier identification in logs, cache, and other places.
- They are used by the CLI for selective updates.

### Reset Unmatched Scores

The `reset_unmatched_scores` property has moved. Previously, you would have specified it like this:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: !secret radarr_nightly_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_nightly_key

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223
          - 90a6f9a284dff5103f6346090e6280c8
          - dc98083864ea246d05a42df0d05f81cc
          - b8cd450cbfa689c0259a01d9e29ba3d6
        quality_profiles:
          - name: SD
            score: 1000
            reset_unmatched_scores: true # This is no longer supported
```

Now you must specify it in the new `quality_profiles` section, like in the below example. You should
repeat this for multiple profiles, if you have them, using the array-style syntax shown.

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: !secret radarr_nightly_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_nightly_key

    # Create this section. It's an array of quality profiles that you have in your instance.
    quality_profiles:
      - name: SD
        reset_unmatched_scores: true # Move it here

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223
          - 90a6f9a284dff5103f6346090e6280c8
          - dc98083864ea246d05a42df0d05f81cc
          - b8cd450cbfa689c0259a01d9e29ba3d6
        quality_profiles:
          - name: SD
            score: 1000
```

The reason for this change is due to quirky logic with specifying this flag multiple times for the
same profile. Now that the flag is attached to a Quality Profile config, it will be more clear how
the value will be set.

:::caution

At the moment, `quality_profiles` does **not create quality profiles for you!** You are still
responsible for ensuring that the quality profile (in the above example, `SD`) exists.

### Replace Existing Custom Formats

One of the principles of Recyclarr is that it does not touch manually created custom formats in
Radarr or Sonarr. Unfortunately, the implementation wasn't completely respectful of this. There are
scenarios where a custom format with the same name as one in the guide will be replaced / updated,
even if Recyclarr didn't create that custom format itself.

Starting with this release, Recyclarr will be more strict about this behavior. If Recyclarr did not
explicitly create a custom format to begin with, then it will refuse to update a custom format that
already exists. This behavior is controlled by the `replace_existing_custom_formats` property, which
previously defaulted to `true`. It now defaults to `false`. To keep the old behavior, you must
explicitly set this property in your configuration:

```yml
radarr:
  movies:
    base_url: !secret radarr_nightly_url
    api_key: !secret radarr_nightly_key

    # Instruct recyclarr to replace custom formats (old behavior)
    replace_existing_custom_formats: true

    custom_formats:
      - trash_ids:
          - 90cedc1fea7ea5d11298bebd3d1d3223
          - 90a6f9a284dff5103f6346090e6280c8
          - dc98083864ea246d05a42df0d05f81cc
          - b8cd450cbfa689c0259a01d9e29ba3d6
```

:::tip

If you're introducing Recyclarr for the first time *and* you've already set up custom formats from
the guide by hand or via another tool, I recommend temporarily setting this to `true` otherwise it
will skip every CF you manually created. I assume that at the start, you want Recyclarr to take
ownership of all of those manually-added CFs from the guide. Once you run it once, you can delete
this property or set it back to `false` and it won't replace manually created, same-named CFs going
forward.

### Removed Migration Steps

The below migration steps are removed. They are from very old versions of Recyclarr that shouldn't
be in use anymore.

- Rename app data directory from `trash-updater` to `recyclarr`
- Rename default `trash.yml` file to `recyclarr.yml`

### Removed CLI Commands

The following CLI commands were previously deprecated and now removed:

| Removed Command           | Replacement (New) Command                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recyclarr radarr`        | [`recyclarr sync radarr`](/cli/sync.md)                   |
| `recyclarr sonarr`        | [`recyclarr sync sonarr`](/cli/sync.md)                   |
