## Breaking Changes

Features have been removed *or* behavior changed. Most of the items here would have been deprecated
in the past. Deprecations are always mentioned in release notes for minor version bumps.

### Reset Unmatched Scores {#reset-scores}

`reset_unmatched_scores` previously was a simple on/off toggle with `true`/`false`, respectively.
For example, to enable it, you'd use this YAML:

```yml
reset_unmatched_scores: true
```

This style is no longer supported. With the introduction of CF exclusions for score resets, the
schema has changed to this (which is equivalent to the above example):

```yml
reset_unmatched_scores:
  enabled: true
```

For more details on the *current syntax*, see the [relevant YAML reference section][resetref].

[resetref]: /yaml/config-reference/quality-profiles.mdx#reset-unmatched-scores

### Sonarr Minimum Version

The minimum required version of Sonarr is now `3.0.9.1549` (increased from the previous minimum
version of `3.0.4.1098`). Users running older versions of Sonarr will be required to upgrade their
Sonarr instance in order to continue using Recyclarr.
