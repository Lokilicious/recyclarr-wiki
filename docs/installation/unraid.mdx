The Unraid platform, due to its popularity, has unique installation methods that will be easier than
doing vanilla [Docker] or [Manual] installation. Specific installation instructions will not be
provided here. Instead, each section will contain links to relevant pages so you can do your own
research.

:::info

The Unraid platform is not an officially supported platform for Recyclarr. This simply means that
all of these solutions are maintained by the community. Recyclarr itself will run just fine on
Unraid. **All credit for these solutions goes to their respective authors and maintainers!**

:::

[Docker]: ./docker.md
[Manual]: ./manual-install.md

## Community App (Template)

A community application (unraid template) exists to run Recyclarr's docker container on Unraid. Go
to the "Apps" tab and search for "recyclarr" to find it. Links to relevant pages are below.
