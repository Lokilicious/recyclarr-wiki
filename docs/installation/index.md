Two methods of installation exist.

## Docker

It is recommended to use the Docker Image to install Recyclarr. Using this method, you get to enjoy
an easier installation process without having to worry about things like file locations,
dependencies, etc. The official docker image is:

```bash
ghcr.io/recyclarr/recyclarr
```

## Manual Installation

Install and run Recyclarr directly on your host machine. This does not utilize Docker at all.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
