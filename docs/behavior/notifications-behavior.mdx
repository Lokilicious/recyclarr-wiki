Recyclarr integrates with [Apprise API][apprise], a versatile notification platform, to offer robust
notification capabilities. This integration allows Recyclarr to send notifications to a wide array
of services, including popular platforms like Discord and Email. For a comprehensive list of
supported notification targets, please refer to the [Apprise documentation][urls].

This page provides an overview of Recyclarr's notification system, explaining its behavior and the
information it provides. Notifications in Recyclarr are designed to keep you informed about sync
operations, providing real-time updates on the process and detailed information about the results.

## Setting Up Notifications

To configure notifications for Recyclarr, you'll need to modify your `settings.yml` file. For
detailed instructions on how to set up notifications, including examples and all available options,
please refer to the [notification settings reference][settings] page.

[settings]: /yaml/settings-reference/notifications.mdx

## Notification Behavior

Currently, Recyclarr's notification system is focused on [sync operations][sync]. Notifications are
designed to be comprehensive, providing a complete overview of the operation without overwhelming
you with too many messages. Here are some key points to understand about the notification behavior:

- **Single Notification per Sync**: Recyclarr sends one consolidated notification for each `sync`
  command execution, regardless of the number of service instances configured in your YAML file.

- **Multi-Service Support**: If you have multiple service instances configured (e.g., 2 Radarr and 1
  Sonarr), the single notification will include information about the sync operation for all
  services.

- **Timing**: The notification is sent upon completion of the entire sync operation across all
  configured services.

## Notification Content

The notification sent after each sync operation includes the following information:

- **Overall Status**: An indication of whether the sync operation was successful or if it failed.

- **Service-Specific Statistics**: For each service instance synced (e.g., Radarr, Sonarr), you'll
  receive high-level statistical information, such as:
  - Number of custom formats synced
  - How many quality profiles were updated
  - Other relevant metrics specific to the service

- **Error and Warning Reports**: Any errors or warnings that occurred during the sync operation are
  included in the notification.
