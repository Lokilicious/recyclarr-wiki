:::info

For a deeper understanding of how notifications work in Recyclarr, please refer to the
[Notifications Behavior](/behavior/notifications-behavior.mdx) page.

:::

## Overview

Notifications in Recyclarr allow you to stay informed about the status and results of your sync
operations. This page explains how to configure notifications using various methods and customize
their behavior.

:::caution

The `notifications` property should only be specified once in your settings YAML file, even though
it may appear in multiple sections of this documentation.

:::

## Apprise Notifications {#apprise}

Apprise is a powerful notification platform that Recyclarr can utilize to send notifications through
various services. There are two modes of operation for Apprise: Stateful and Stateless.

:::caution

Configuring and using Apprise itself is beyond the scope of this wiki page and Recyclarr support
channels. For Apprise-specific questions, please consult the appropriate Apprise support resources.

:::

### Stateful Mode {#stateful}

In stateful mode, Apprise API manages the configuration of notification URLs.

```yml
notifications:
  apprise:
    mode: stateful
    base_url: http://localhost:8000
    key: recyclarr
    tags: foo bar, baz
```

Configuration options for stateful mode:

- `mode` *(Required)*: Set to `stateful` to enable this mode.
- `base_url` *(Required)*: The base URL of your Apprise API server.
- `key` *(Required)*: Represents a configuration file on the Apprise API server that determines
  notification destinations.
- `tags` *(Optional)*: Filters notifications to URLs with specific tags. Use commas (`,`) for OR
  logic and spaces (` `) for AND logic.

### Stateless Mode {#stateless}

Stateless mode is useful when you want to use Apprise API without persistent storage. In this mode,
Recyclarr's settings contain the list of notification URLs.

```yml
notifications:
  apprise:
    mode: stateless
    base_url: http://localhost:8000
    urls:
      - https://discord.com/api/webhooks/secret
```

Configuration options for stateless mode:

- `mode` *(Required)*: Set to `stateless` to enable this mode.
- `base_url` *(Required)*: The base URL of your Apprise API server.
- `urls` *(Required)*: One or more URLs where Apprise will send notifications. For supported URL
  types, consult the [Apprise API
  documentation](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki#notification-services).

## Notification Verbosity {#verbosity}

You can control the frequency and content of notifications by adjusting the verbosity level:

```yml
notifications:
  verbosity: normal # Options: normal, detailed, minimal
```

To help you choose the appropriate verbosity level, it's important to understand the types of
content that can be included in Recyclarr notifications:

- **Errors**: Critical issues that typically cause sync failures.
- **Warnings**: Important messages indicating necessary user actions, such as updating deprecated
  configurations.
- **Information**: Statistics and details about sync actions, like the number of Custom Formats
  synced.
- **Sync Status**: Overall success or failure of the sync operation, usually shown in the
  notification title.

These content types are used to determine what information is included in notifications based on the
chosen verbosity level.

Verbosity levels:

- `minimal`: Sends notifications only for warnings or errors. Informational and empty messages are
  suppressed.
- `normal` (default): Sends notifications for warnings, errors, and statistical information. Empty
  messages (e.g., when nothing was synced) are not sent.
- `detailed`: Includes everything from the `normal` level, plus notifications for empty messages
  (e.g., when no changes were synced).
