This page covers two different ways to configure Apprise notifications in Recyclarr: Stateless Mode
and Stateful Mode.

:::caution

Details regarding how to use and configure Apprise itself is outside of the scope of this wiki page
and, in particular, Recyclarr support channels. Apprise-specific questions should be directed to the
appropriate Apprise support channels.

:::

## Stateful Mode

When using [stateful mode], the details of which specific URLs to publish notifications to is
controlled by Apprise API configuration.

[stateful mode]: https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api#persistent-stateful-storage-solution

```yml
notifications:
  apprise:
    mode: stateful
    base_url: http://localhost:8000
    key: recyclarr
    tags: foo bar, baz
```

Reference for the `apprise` section is below. Note that most of these values are forwarded directly
to Apprise API and you should rely on their documentation for more information.

- `mode` *(Required)*<br/>
  Set this to `stateful` to enable stateful mode.

- `base_url` *(Required)*<br/>
  This is the base URL of the Apprise API server that Recyclarr should send notifications to.

- `key` *(Required)*<br/>
  The key represents a configuration file on the Apprise API server that will be used to determine
  where notifications are sent.

- `tags` *(Optional)*<br/>
  Optionally notify only those URLs tagged accordingly. Use a comma (`,`) to `OR` your tags and a
  space (` `) to `AND` them.

## Stateless Mode

Use [stateless mode] when you want to sidecar the Apprise API without it having access to storage.
This means that Recyclarr's notification settings will contain the list of URLs to publish
notifications to.

[stateless mode]: https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api#stateless-mode

```yml
notifications:
  apprise:
    mode: stateless
    base_url: http://localhost:8000
    urls:
      - https://discord.com/api/webhooks/secret
```

Reference for the `apprise` section is below. Note that most of these values are forwarded directly
to Apprise API and you should rely on their documentation for more information.

- `mode` *(Required)*<br/>
  Set this to `stateless` to enable stateless mode.

- `base_url` *(Required)*<br/>
  This is the base URL of the Apprise API server that Recyclarr should send notifications to.

- `urls` *(Required)*<br/>
  One or more URLs that apprise will forward notifications to. If you want to know what kind of URLs
  to put here, please visit the [Apprise API documentation][urls].
