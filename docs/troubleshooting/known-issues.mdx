A list of known issues related to Recyclarr. If an issue is listed here, it typically means that
this shouldn't be considered a bug, but a missing feature or improvement that is needed but hasn't
been considered due to there not being a need for it yet.

- Custom Formats with "Size Specification" cannot be synced from the guide. This hasn't been
  addressed because the guides explicitly avoid using this specification.
